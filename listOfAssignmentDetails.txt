This is just a file to make sure we don't miss anything
To mark the progress of what we still need to do.

D  Completed


-p GameBoard Class
    -E printGameBoard method

-p Main Class
    -  Main
    -D  checkPerpendicular Slopes
    -K endcondition
        #all cells are filled, or two perpendicular plays in a row
    -K  read input from file
	#K I started this in a while loop in main, but if there's a way to put it in
	   a method we should do that!
    -D  test value for validity
        # this should include perpendicular, and that start and end cells are empty
	# I split this into two methods, one for perpendicular and one for start/end cells
	-D  valid perpendicular
	-E  valid start/end cells
        #created another method to be able to adjust the values in the queue, with the value of k
    -E  addplay to the GameBoard
    -K  determine Winner
        #the one with the most amount of cells covered
    K  calculate the slope of line
    -E calculate which cells are 
    
THINGS TO DO
    Add a control method
    printGameBoard to File, ask user for file destination. 
    Test second file, as well
